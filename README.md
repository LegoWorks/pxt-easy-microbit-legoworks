This extension was made to make easier the use of some Microbit funtions as Pin use or (in a future) serial connection or PID.

You can import it and use some functionalities as:

- Manage digital pins.
- Magane analog pins.

In a futures, we want to implement some other functionalities as.

- PID implementations
